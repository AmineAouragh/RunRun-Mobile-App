- The app class the times made by each runner on the group from the first with the best time to the last one so they can get motivated and compete with each other
- The app can class them by divisions (like at football leagues) the first 10 in the 1st division and the other 10 in the 2nd one. A runner should make better times to go up.
- A runner can set his goal and the app can help him by keeping track of his progress with diet and trainings
- A runner can organize a race with his friends or other runners on a group on a calendar built in the app
- In a race, the app can calculate the speed and distance covered by each competitor and update the class board in real-time. 
- 24 Hours before the race the app can send a notification reminder for each runner involved
- The app can launch a race with a sound similar ro rhe starter's pistol
- Users can invite their friends to use the app
